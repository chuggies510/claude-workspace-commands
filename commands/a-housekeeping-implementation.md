# Housekeeping Implementation

When /a-housekeeping is called:
1. Launch the housekeeping-cleanup agent using Task tool
2. Agent type: housekeeping-cleanup (Opus)

## Agent Execution

## Step 1: File Inventory
```bash
find . -type f -name "*.md" -o -name "*.csv" | grep -v ".claude" | sort
```

## Step 2: Identify Consolidation Targets

### Files to Merge
- `equipment-comparison-analysis.md` → merge into building-profile.md notes
- `equipment-conflicts.md` → merge into building-profile.md conflicts section
- `equipment-extraction-ready.md` → DELETE (data now in CSV)
- `equipment-gaps-analysis.md` → merge with below
- `equipment-lifecycle-gaps.md` → merge with below
- `data-collection-requirements.md` → KEEP as master requirements

### Files to Clean
- `validation-report-5.1.md` → extract key findings only
- `equipment-age-analysis.md` → merge with summary
- `equipment-age-logic.md` → merge with summary
- `equipment-age-summary.md` → KEEP as master age document

## Step 3: Language Cleanup Patterns

### Search and Destroy
```
grep -l "It's important to note\|It's worth mentioning\|Comprehensive analysis\|This document provides\|Generated by\|Analysis Complete\|Key insights\|Key findings" *.md
```

### Simplification Rules
1. Remove all lines starting with "**Generated**:", "**Purpose**:", "**Created**:"
2. Delete sections titled "Overview", "Introduction", "Conclusion", "Summary"
3. Remove bullet points that just repeat headings
4. Eliminate "Note:" unless critical safety/technical info
5. Delete any paragraph over 3 sentences - break up or simplify

## Step 4: Consolidation Process

### Create Master Files

**equipment-master-data.md**
- Current age distribution
- Replacement schedule
- Missing data list
- No fluff, just tables and facts

**validation-summary.md**
- What was checked
- What was corrected
- What remains
- One page maximum

## Step 5: Deletion List

### Delete These Files After Consolidation
```bash
rm -f equipment-extraction-ready.md
rm -f equipment-comparison-analysis.md
rm -f equipment-conflicts.md
rm -f equipment-age-analysis.md
rm -f equipment-age-logic.md
rm -f validation-report-5.1.md
```

### Keep These Files
```bash
# Core files - DO NOT DELETE
building-profile.md
equipment-table.csv
equipment-master-data.md (new consolidated)
validation-summary.md (new consolidated)
data-collection-requirements.md
tasks/*
CLAUDE.md
.claude/*
```

## Step 6: Final Cleanup

### Remove AI-speak from remaining files
```bash
sed -i 's/It is important to note that //g' *.md
sed -i 's/It.s worth mentioning //g' *.md
sed -i 's/This comprehensive //This /g' *.md
sed -i 's/facilitate/enable/g' *.md
sed -i 's/utilize/use/g' *.md
sed -i 's/ensure/check/g' *.md
```

## Step 7: Report Results
```
Files before: [count]
Files after: [count]
Files deleted: [list]
Files consolidated: [list]
Bytes saved: [amount]
```
