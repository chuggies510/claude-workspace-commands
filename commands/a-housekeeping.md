Run the housekeeping-cleanup agent to clean up project files, remove duplication, eliminate AI-speak, and delete temporary work files.

## Usage
```
/a-housekeeping
```

## Agent
Uses the `housekeeping-cleanup` agent (Opus model)

## What It Does

1. **Inventories** all files in current project directory
2. **Identifies** duplicate content and redundant files
3. **Consolidates** related information into master files
4. **Removes** AI-generated verbose language
5. **Deletes** temporary and intermediate work files
6. **Preserves** essential data and deliverables

## Protected Files (Never Deleted)
- CSV data files
- building-profile.md
- CLAUDE.md files
- Task lists
- Field notes
- Cost cards
- Client deliverables

## Files Typically Removed
- Individual validation reports
- Intermediate analyses
- Extraction/preparation files
- Comparison documents
- Gap analyses (after consolidation)
- Files with verbose AI descriptions

## Language Cleanup

### DO Clean Up:
- "It's important to note..."
- "Comprehensive analysis..."
- "This document provides..."
- Redundant summaries
- Excessive explanations

### DO NOT Modify:
- Metadata footers (Generated by:, Created:, Last Updated:, etc.)
- Paragraph structure (keep paragraphs as paragraphs)
- Technical formatting that aids readability

## End Result
- 50%+ fewer files
- 30%+ less text
- Clean, technical language
- No lost data
- Organized structure
